		<p class="exploc">PCS FOR PEOPLE &#8226; St. Paul, MN</p>
        <p class="exptitle">REPAIR TECHNICIAN/COMPUTER PROGRAMMER</p>
        <p class="expdesc">As versatile a member of a small nonprofit organization, with limited staff, I challenged myself to go above and beyond my required tasks by taking on necessary but unassigned tasks. A programming role was created, allowing me to continue creating and managing software applications utilized in the refurbishment process.</p>
        <p class="expnotable">Notable Project: QA Helper</p>
        <p class="expdesc"><strong>Problem: </strong>Linux and macOS machines were manually refurbished and not recorded in the PCs for People Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) software.</p>
        <p class="expdesc"><strong>Solution: </strong>Working in Java, I created an application to mimic the existing QA Helper program used in Windows refurbishment. This program applied PC for People branding, installed commonly used applications, provided buttons to easily test installed software and drivers, gathered hardware statistics for each machine and communicated necessary information to the PCs for People ERP software using SOAP.</p>

        <p><span class="exptitle">FRONT DESK/OPERATIONS PROGRAM ASSOCIATE/BUSINESS AUTOMATION ANALYST</span><br>
		<span class="expdept">(Parking and Transportation Department)</span></p>
        <p class="expdesc">Functioning under two separate, but simultaneous roles, I focused on my goals of improving office workflow and efficiency, and earned a position newly devised for assessing, attaining, managing and updating technology which improved performance and satisfaction of colleagues.</p>
        <p class="expnotable">Notable Project: Cash Journal Report</p>
        <p class="expdesc"><strong>Problem: </strong>Budgeting requirements dictated that any revenue generated by permit sales needed to be allocated to lot maintenance, and any revenue generated by ticket payments needed to be allocated to enforcement staff wages. The financial reports provided by the Automated Issuance/Management System (AIMS) software used by the parking office, did not include a way to determine separation of funds in this fashion and it was calculated manually. This process took 3-5 hours per week, and custom AIMS reports from the retailer were priced at $1,300.</p>
        <p class="expdesc"><strong>Solution: </strong>Using the AIMS Report Designer's export function, and a DataDictionary provided by the AIMS support staff, I was able to construct custom XML files detailing queries to be loaded by a new report, thus paving the way for reports that were tailored to the needs of the parking office, starting with a daily Cash Journal Report that listed each drawer's individual transactions, and a totals section on the bottom that not only showed the total revenue broken down by payment method, but separated the funds into categories for easy deposit. This report turned 3-5 hours into 15 minutes per week.</p>

		<span class="expdept">(Point of Sale)</span></p>
        <p class="expdesc">Dedicated and eager, as an intern, I quickly absorbed new software, sought new challenges and produced results. Recognized for ambition and quality results, I was given a promotion, allowing me to continue creating and maintaining software under  full-time status.</p>
        <p class="expnotable">Notable Project: Wire Remnant System</p>
        <p class="expdesc"><strong>Problem: </strong>Wire remnants were being advertised at full-price, but not being sold due to low need for the length of wire left on the spool.</p>
        <p class="expdesc"><strong>Solution: </strong>Using PROGRESS, I built a tracking system for wire remnants that provided all of the same functionality as the carpet remnant system (special order creation/automatic discount calucaltion/label printing/on-screen inventory view/automated weekly summary emails), but catered to the needs of the electrical department. One of the major differences being that the wire remnant tags were to be printed on a blank 5x7 piece of tag board(as opposed to an 8x10 template form with preprinted fields, designs and logos), which meant I got to design the wire remnant label completely from scratch, and the label I created is still in use today, by all 250 Menards stores, after 10 years!</p>
